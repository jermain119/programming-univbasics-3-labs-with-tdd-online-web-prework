# assining intergers
first_number=6
second_number=2
# assingining sum to first_number & second_number
sum= first_number + second_number
# assingining difference to first_number & second_number
difference= first_number - second_number
assingining product to first_number & second_number
product= first_number * second_number
assingining quotient to first_number & second_number
quotient= first_number / second_number
